We did complete the todo app.\n\nThe usage of code snippets to aid with live coding was a nice touch.\n\nTime for the group photo & lunch !\n\n\nSession 4. 13:30\n\nVue + Firebase\n\nMy friends and I got a little early in the room and settled down waiting for the session to start.\n\nThe speakers introduced themselves as two freelancers and carried on with the prez in a very relaxed style.\n\nVidush & Priyesh explained their choice of tech, i.e vue + firebase.\n\nThe session was about creating a vue application with real time chat capabilities.\n\nThe showed their boilerplate code, which is typescript flavoured vue, which I don't particularly like. But that’s just me.\n\nVS Code was used with a light theme.\n\nThey showed how to create a collection on firebase and how to deploy the app on Firebase Hosting.\n\nThe session was very interesting and afterwards I had a chat about issues I encountered with Firebase auth mixed with Vue-Router.\n\n\nSession 5 14.30\n\nGo : Turbocharge your programs\n\nBy this time most of the students were mostly outside eating cake and talking to each other. There was a great dessert table set for everyone after all.\n\nYusuf and Jules from LSL digital spoke about why they picked go and proceeded with a demo of what language can do. The demo showed how easy it was to build a websocket powered chat application with minimal tooling.\n\n\nSession 6 15:30\n\nWorkbox Wizardry\n\nHe talks about how things that PWA focuses on are very obvious and known to us africans. I couldn’t agree more.\n\nHaving performance on low powered devices and not waste bandwidth comes naturally to us, because it is a necessity.\n\nWe set out on an ambitious journey to livecode a meme generator, which was a bumpy ride. That happens.\n\nThe session was full of useful information and the Q & A that followed was very lively and informative.\n\n\nClosing\n\nImmediately after this session, it was time to wrap up the event and joki used the Google photo album as background during the closing session as he thanked all the attendees, sponsors and helpers.\n\nHe encouraged attendees to shout out the event to more people and write blog posts about it.\n\nDevcon 2020 was hinted to be around April 2020, which I'm very excited about. Anyone who wants to help with building the Devcon 2020 website, get in touch with me on twitter.\n\nOne very unusual thing I noticed is that all the sessions I attended used VS Code with a LIGHT Theme ! I am a strong advocate of dark mode for health and accessibility reasons, however during daylight, the light theme was clearly more readable. I should go outside more, they say the graphics are amazing.",

Note that the delay duration should be half the duration of 1 slide, we use calc to help us figure out the value.\n\n    <div class=\"slideshow\"></div>\n    <div class=\"slideshow slideshow2\"></div>\n\n  .slideshow {\n   --numberOfImages: 5;\n  --duration: 20s;\n  --fadeDuration: calc(var(--duration) / var(--numberOfImages));\n  --delay-duration: calc(var(--fadeDuration) / 2 )\n  \n    animation: changeImage var(--duration) linear infinite, fade var(--fadeDuration) linear infinite;\n  }\n  .slideshow2 {\n    animation: \n        changeImage var(--duration) var(--delay-duration) linear infinite, \n        fade var(--fadeDuration) var(--delay-duration) linear infinite;\n  }\n\nAnd now we have a smooth slideshow powered by the CSS features:\n\n * Custom Properties / CSS Variables\n * animation\n * calc()\n\n\nFinal Demo\n\n\nImages Credits\n\nAll images used in the demo were from Unsplash tagged under Mauritius\n\nAuthors:\n\n * Arwin Neil Baichoo\n * John O'Nolan\n * Xavier Coiffic\n\n\nBonus: Web Component\n\nAfter sharing this little trick with Cedric, he quickly made a web-component out of it.\n\nYou may check the web component here :\n\nSource : https://github.com/cedpoilly/fec-slideshow\n\nDemo : https://cedpoilly.github.io/fec-slideshow/\n\n\n",

I hope this post helps the talented people who can draw amazing stuff on paper to digitize and even animate their content.\n\nTLDR; Tracing using Figma\n\n\nStep 1: Draw\n\nOf course you need a source image. Draw the shape you're looking to vectorize on paper. I can't draw, so I asked @smearthelove to help me out with this part\n\n\nStep 2: Take a picture\n\nNext up, take a picture using your phone and send that to your workstation.\nA trick to take better pictures without using a scanner would be via the Office Lens app(optional).\n\n\nStep 3: Place the image in Figma\n\nFigma is a free design tool that runs in the browser. Open a new document then drag and drop your image. It's ideal to separate each drawing on it's own layer before proceeding. Duplicate the layers and crop every shape until they're on different layers. You don't have to do this if you have just one image of course.\n\n\nStep 4: Image Tracer Plugin for Figma\n\nInstall the Image Tracer plugin by navigating to figma.com/c\n\nSelect an image and apply the Image Tracer plugin by selecting it from the menu.\n\nThe plugin does what you would normally require a license and installation of Adobe Illustrator to achieve this. This right here, works in the browser and accessible within seconds to anyone. Open Source is amazing ! Image Tracer was created by David Williames.\n\nYou now have a vectorized version of the previously bitmap image at your disposal.\n\n\nStep 5: Export to SVG\n\nExport the image as SVG using the export feature of figma at the bottom right corner.\n\nYou can now use the SVG in a webpage via an img tag or by adding the SVG inline.\n\nHere's how the inline SVG looks like :\n\n<svg width=\"434\"

            "plaintext": "After a stop at the Post Office in Port Louis, I managed to reach the Flying Dodo just in time for the meetup. This time \"Go: All you ever wanted to know but didn't dare to ask...\" was happening, an event by GDG Mauritius.\n\nYusuf kick off the meetup by thanking everyone for their presence during these festive periods and continued to introduce Gophers.mu and their upcoming logo. He also welcomed Natalie, a Google Developer Expert, who is currently on the island and was kind enough to join the event and even do a presentation !\n\nLast talk for the year at @GDGMauritius!\n\nThanks to @JKirstaetter and the team for hosting the event and bringing the #golang community to the island.\n\nAnd look at the potential gopher+dodo logos🥰 pic.twitter.com/dzMeRjY6wK\n\n— Natalie (@NataliePis) December 21, 2019\n\n\n\nThere was a short introduction about Go, and promises of go. It was very interesting to see how much the creators of the language care about the philosophical aspect of designing a language.\n\nJeshta, showed a demo about how to download images of cat using a simple Go program and walk the audience through the code line by line. The session was short and sweet and the code seemed very readable. That's one thing I appreciate about go.\n\nFirst talk:\nJeshta Bhoyedhur is giving examples on concurrency and wait groups in #golang pic.twitter.com/PxwQqvdwEL\n\n— Natalie (@NataliePis) December 21, 2019\n\n\n\nGrant, a fellow Mauritian gopher who doesn't exist on the internet, intervened to share his love for Go and explain a few concepts. The intervention was interactive and very well received by the audience.\n\nIt was already time for a short break/networking session which lasted around 15 minutes.\n\nWhen we came back from the break, Natalie spoke about about her early journey and there was an intriguing mention about DefCon which she quotes as inspirational. She commented she was mind-blown after attending the conference and how are we not getting hacked everyday. Which triggered a change in her career path.\n\nThere was a very enlightening presentation titled : \"Going Secure with Go\".\n\nQ&A after @NataliePis's talk on #Golang and #Security. pic.twitter.com/pG4qTAj1SD\n\n— Ish Sookun (@IshSookun) December 21, 2019\n\n\n\nCrypto random library was recommended over simple random library or using the Time library to reduce predictability.\n\nA random conversation emerged when Natalie mentioned escaping SQL statements to avoid sql injection. Jochen said one shouldn't have sql statements in your code at all and a few attendees mentioned about how practical that is in reality. It was a fun little interaction which could be a debate/meetup in itself.\n\nAfter her presentation there was a few questions from the audience. I naturally asked about applying the security recommendation to frontend stacks.\n\nShe tweeted some resources that we could use to verify and keep up to date with security news, get better at solving problems and getting started with go.\n\nTo all the new gophers who have attended the talk at @GDGMauritius today, here is a great first step to get familiarized with #golang\n\nIntro to the language:https://t.co/MsEhUnBEhE\n\nGo exercises:https://t.co/Hfa4Lidptk\n\nVulnerablities database:https://t.co/eyZs8PU9ip\n\n— Natalie (@NataliePis) December 21, 2019\n\n\n\nLunch break of 30minutes!\n\nWhen we resumed, Mr Daniel spoke about the startup atmosphere in Berlin.

            "plaintext": "CSS Variables are also commonly known as \"CSS Custom Properties\". These terms can be used interchangeably. They do what you would expect them to : define variables and be able to refer back to them in your CSS.\n\nThey're very powerful compared to what we were used to in front-end land, and can be sometimes abused. Not sure if that's good or bad. But hey, look ma! NO JS!\n\nHere's what you need to know, and more :\n\n\nWhy?\n\nThey're variables. They help you write better code with less repetition and more maintainability.\n\n\nHow to definine a CSS Variable\n\nHere are 3 examples of custom property definitions. Yes, they're all string/text.\n\n.container {\n    --blue: '#004a8f';\n    --size: '10px';\n    --shadowLarge: '0 0 10px #000';\n}\n\n\nHow to use a CSS Variable\n\nThe syntax is weird, but there's a good reason for that and some advantages too.\n\n.container {\n    --color: 'red';\n    background: var(--color);\n}\n\nIt looks like a function call, where the argument is the name of the CSS Variable.\n\n\nScope of CSS Variables\n\nAs you may have noticed in the example above, CSS Variables need to be defined within a selector scope.\n\nIf you try to use the CSS Variables outside this scope it will not work.\n\n.container {\n    --borderWidth: '2px';\n}\n\n/* Bad. Will NOT work, unless .wrapper is a child of .container */\n.wrapper {\n    border: var(--borderWidth) solid black;\n}\n\nYou may use the CSS Variables in child elements as they inherit from their parents.\n\nIf you need to define Global CSS Variables, you may do that using the :root pseudo element:\n\n:root {\n    --myGlobalVariable: '#fff';\n}\n\nSince the ::root element is parent to html, the entire DOM is considered it's children.\n\n\nCSS Variables can have fallbacks\n\nPlot-twist! They can have multiple parameters, which serve as fallbacks\n\n.container {\n    background: var(--color, blue);\n}       \n\nIn the example above the --color variable is never defined, hence it will fallback to the 2nd parameter and you have a blue background. The fallback can also be a CSS Variable.\n\n\nInline CSS Variables\n\nIt's possible to define the css variable inline, like you would do with any normal css.\n\n<div style=\"--color: 'red'\" class=\"container\"></div>\n\n.container {\n    color: var(--color);\n    border: 1px solid var(--color);\n}\n\nThis opens huge possibilities when combined with JS. Let's assume you're using a simple VueJS app to create toggle, you could easily combine them as follows:\n\n<div :style=\"'--color: ${themeColor}'\" class=\"container\"></div>\n\nThis technique delegates all the rendering responsibilities to CSS and lets you fine tune the moving parts with JavaScript. We want this.\n\n\nBrowser Support\n\nUse them if you don't need to support IE11. If you do need to support IE11, you have my sympathy.\n\n\nBONUS : Houdini API & Custom Properties\n\nThis part is brand new and it's ok if you're not ready to dive into Houdini right now. No pressure.\n\nYou might have noticed all the custom properties we defined were 'text', i.e they have no Types. With the Houdini API it is possible to register a CSS Custom Property using the registerProperty method.\n\nThe code is very simple and looks like this\n\nwindow.CSS.registerProperty({\n  name: '--borderColor',\n  syntax: '<color>',\n  inherits: false,\n  initialValue: 'red',\n});\n\nYou might wonder, why ? Consider the following example :\n\n.thing {\n  --borderColor: \"0 0 10px solid\";\n  border: 1px solid var(--borderColor);\n}\n\nThe value of --borderColor will obviously not work because it's not a color and we would end up with no border color.\n\nWith the help of the registerProperty however, it would detect that the value is not a valid <color> and fallback to the red color as defined in the type definition.\n\nYou can learn more by reading the article \"Smarter custom properties with Houdini’s new API\" by Sam Richard\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this article makes it easier for you to deal with custom properties in the future. As you have seen, it's really simple & powerful.",

The audio reached the media and the police within minutes.\nNow he's very safe in a cell somewhere. dreC sa frero, pas vin gat valer zenfant\nross boi ;) \n\nWhatsapp has been a hive for spreading fakenews since the past few weeks. Every\nsmall news travels at incredible speeds. Sometimes I am shocked by reading\nmessages, what they contains, how obviously fake they appear to be, and yet\npeople keep passing them aorund. Fake news always existed, and it's never going\naway. Technology has amplified it and the solution is yet to be found. That's\nanother topic though. Some other time.\n\nVideo conferencing\nEveryone and their aunt (literally), are now doing video calls. Including the\nG20 people. For people in tech, this is something trivial and normal. However\nI've withnessed a rise in religious activities through video calls, kirtan\nsessions, hawans, madrassa online just to name a few. People gather in a video\ncall and pray together. Maybe this is a shock for atheists, but this is how\nnon-athesists deal with anxiety and bolster their hope. Everyone have their\ncoping mechanism. (mine is code and music btw)\n\nFront-liners\nThe heroes of 2020. These are the people who are helping on the ground and\nbegging us to stay at home while they risk their lives every minute for the rest\nof us. The word grateful isn't enough to describe what we owe them. They are\npeople, like us, they are vulnerable to the virus. \n\nThere have been some videos of police officers abusing power and filming it\nthemselves to put on facebook. While I don't fully understand why they would\nfilm themselves doing something illegal, it makes me wonder weather these scene\nproved to be successfull in discouraging disobedience and idiocy by some, who\nfail to grasp reason when the medium of language is used as means of\ncommunication.\n\nForget not that doctors and nurses working in the hospitals treating covid19\nhave to be in quarantine for two weeks before they can see their families again.\nThis is not easy. The least we can do is stay home and ask others to stay home. \n\nChaos\nThere have been a few attempts to abuse the current situation for robbery in a\nhandful of cases, luckily not too many. Maybe someone was in dire need of food\nfor their family and they had no other choice ! Like the people who stole liquor\nand went to sell it the next day. Incredibly hungry people indeed. Chaos is not\nhere despite that. At least not yet and I hope, not ever. \n\nSoil\nNeedless to say, after this is over everyone is going to plant their own fruits\nand vegetables. People will value the soil in their yard more and will be less\nlikely to cover it with concrete. That is inevitable, but we're not sure the\nnext generation will remember, until they face first hand, something similar.\nBut we have recordings now, an endless amount of archive, maybe this time\nhistory will infact be remembered. Unlike the other great plagues that the\nTau'ri have faced.\n\nThis pandemic is going to have positive effects on our future. It's going to\nbring some balance. But in the process we are losing people, actual people. They\nare dying by the thousands. this is not worth any positive effects. \n\nI'd rather keep the people alive and improve some other way. \n\nCan we revert to December 2019 and start over please?",

Google \nclaims that it executes JS\n[https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/05/the-new-evergreen-googlebot.html]and\nwill render your page, but too many times I have seen websites built with\nfront-end frameworks get completely ignored if you don't setup Google Search\nConsole. \n\nYou might want to the Nuxt route by default to resolve this issue, however you\ncould settle for  a middle ground solution and generate a simple sitemap.xml \nfile that ships with your front-end app. \n\nNuxt makes is super easy to generate sitemaps using this plugin\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/sitemap]. In my quest to find out if it's\npossible to automate this task in a VueJS app, i stumbled across a reply by\nLinusBorg [https://forum.vuejs.org/t/ssr-generate-sitemap-xml/42401/2]on the\nVueJS forums.\n\nHe suggested using a Webpack plugin. This sounds perfect as it would only\ngenerate the sitemap file on build using a bunch of configs. So let's dive into\nit. \n\nInstall the webpack plugin as a dev dependency\n\nnpm install sitemap-webpack-plugin --save-dev\n\nWebpack configurations live inside the vue.config.js file, so you want it to\nlook something like this:\n\nAdjust vue.config.js \n\nconst SitemapPlugin = require('sitemap-webpack-plugin').default;\nconst paths = [\n    {\n        path: '/',\n        lastmod: new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10),\n        priority: '0.8',\n        changefreq: 'hourly'\n    },\n];\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    configureWebpack: {\n        plugins: [\n            new SitemapPlugin('https://mywebsite.com', paths, {\n                filename: 'sitemap.xml',\n                lastmod: true,\n                changefreq: 'hourly',\n                priority: '0.8'\n            })\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nSitemap configuration in vue.config.jsNotice the lastmod key being set to the new date javascript expression. This\nwill make sure the last modified date is set to the build time and in the\ncorrect format. You can set it as a static string if that's what you want.\n\nYou're good to go! \n\nI've implemented this in the Covid19 Mauritius [https://covid19.ramgolam.com] \npage yesterday. You can see the commit here\n[https://github.com/MrSunshyne/covid19-mauritius/commit/3411a4bf2fd758373ea245d6e334083432c5f70b]\n:\n\nImprovements?\nIt should be possible to derive all the paths automatically using the Vue Router\nobject. I'll leave that for a later blog post.",

Storybook itself makes conversations with the client easier as they can understand things better when making a decision.</blockquote><p>It was also interesting to see how University Students replied to some questions of the speaker, such as \"How do you collaborate when doing a project\". The speaker was hinting at the use of git and how storybook would be an even better tool on top of git. But unfortunately it appears they couldn't differentiate between GitHub and git in the first place. So there's some ground work to be done there.

            "plaintext": "I reached around 9.30am to grab some soft drinks and pain au chocolats at Intermart for the attendees before heading to the venue. We waited for the attendees to be seated and the meetup started at around 10.20AM\n\n\nIntro Session\n\nThis time I didn't have any session to present, which gave me more time to prepare the slides for the intro segment. I used this template from Figma and customized it a little to suit front-end coders. As usual, I explained who are the front-end coders and why we host meetups, thank the sponsor, introduce the speakers, suggest the topic for next month's meetup. I also left just one slide of CSS tips, since I'm not presenting anything else today.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n * Percy Mamedy - Modern monolith with Laravel & InertiaJs\n * Ish Sookun - Laravel Livewire\n * Ravish Dussaruth - Setting up Laravel & NextJs with Breeze\n * Yusuf Abdool Satar (Gophers.mu)—How to structure a go program\n\n\nTopic 1 : Percy Mamedy - Modern monolith with Laravel & InertiaJs\n\nPercy gave a great tour of InertiaJS and how it works. He built a simple frontend + backend to-do application which communicates via axios API calls, then he proceeded to refactor the application live in front of the audience to make it become an IntertiaJS app with Laravel + Vue.\n\nHonestly, I thought this was a very good approach to build web apps that are already using Laravel and want to have better integration with their frontends. Will definitely use it in the future. Percy described IntertiaJS as an alternative routing library for Vue, which instantly helps clarify the technology.\n\n\nTopic 2: Ish Sookun - Laravel Livewire\n\nIsh was next and he also gave a live demo using a light theme on Livewire. He made a good looking application that lists names in a data table, and show how he was able to add pagination and search very easily while not writing much (if any) JavaScript.\n\nThe simplicity of the tech works was quite impressive. Livewire appears to be inspired from Hotwire. aka HTML over the Wire.\n\n\nLunch\n\nWe took a lunch break and had panarotti pizzas, and took the time to network a bit. It was a fun and jovial ambiance. We had a group photo right after lunch\n\n\nSponsor Segment\n\n\nBefore resuming the next talk we had Rachid from XEFI who gave our attendees an overview of their company and what they do. He shared some interesting details about an Academy to train people and the potential for installing a Data Center in the region. \\\n\n\nTopic 3 : Ravish Dussaruth - Setting up Laravel & NextJs with Breeze\n\nUp next, Ravish showed a demo of how to make a Laravel app talk to NextJS using breeze. It was really a breeze how easy and fast it was to set up.\n\n\nTopic 4 : Yusuf Abdool Satar (Gophers.mu) - How to structure a go program\n\nFor the final presentation, Yusuf from Gophers.mu shared his experience about structuring Go programs and the reasoning behind his proposed structure.\n\nI thought it was very enlightening, even if I don't write go myself. His structure is inspired by the Go Standard library.\n\n\nCredits\n\nThanks to Nadim for helping us get this location and handling communications with the people at XEFI!\n\nThanks to Neil and Ish for taking pictures of the event ! You can see them on this album.\n\nThanks to Saamiyah, Kushul and Mahima for helping with the website and pre-event logistics like RSVP and ordering lunch.\n\n\nRandom pictures of the event\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was yet another awesome session and all attendees seemed to have a good time. Some of us headed out to Flying Dodo to hang out post-meetup till the evening ! Until next time!",

            "plaintext": "The 5th frontend meetup of the year was structured a little differently from the previous ones. We went for a lightning-talk style this time, which means more speakers and shorter sessions. This has the advantage of covering a larger range of topics, but doesn't let the presenter deep dive in the subject. The topic this time around was Fancy New Tech, in which we tried to cover a lot of the “new” web technologies that are sometimes legit, sometimes buzzwords ! The goal was to have an overview of each tech and let the audience member investigate further if they're interested. Also, we had a semi-outdoor setup in the beautiful office of ACENSI Mauritius.\n\n\nIntro Session\n\nAs usual, I kicked off the session by introducing who are the frontend coders, why we do meetups, and a few updates. We have a new homepage on the website, we have published photos from previous meetups on the website (thanks @mgjules for the awesome photo-sync project)\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n * Sandeep Ramgolam - Bun a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime\n * Mahima Ramgolam - Sli.dev - Presentation tool for developers\n * Arwin Neil Baichoo - WebAssembly\n * Jordan Bievenue - Photogrammetry\n * Percy Mamedy - Splade - The magic of Inertia.js with the simplicity of Blade\n * Renghen P. - Carbon Lang\n * Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer - Contracting: Sharpening the edge to deliver\n * Michaël Jules - Astro: fast websites next-gen island architecture.\n\n\nSponsor Segment\n\nBefore starting with the first presentation, The MD of ACENSI Mauritius Reena Seetohul introduced her company and her team and gave an overview of what they do. Of course, they're recruiting if you're interested!\n\n\nSandeep Ramgolam - Bun a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime\n\nI spoke about the new JavaScript all-in-one runtime name bun. I introduced the project and the people around it (well 1 person). Unfortunately I couldnt demo what it did because I was getting segfaults while trying it on Linux in a bare bones create-react-app.\n\n\nMahima Ramgolam - Sli.dev - Presentation tool for developers\n\nMahima spoke about sli.dev which is a very simple but powerful tool for creating presentations using Markdown. She demonstrated how to create slides, use themes, format the slides and even cool features like having Video or Annotation during a presentation.\n\n\nArwin Neil Baichoo - Web Assembly\n\nArwin spoke about the what and why's of WebAssembly, pointing out the useful use cases with a couple of demos. The first demo was a rust program that compiled to web assembly, then was called using JavaScript in a webpage.\n\nIt was very enlightening to see how the process actually works and “what talks to what”. He then ran a video converter, using ffmpeg, in-browser to convert a file from video to GIF.\n\n\nJordan Bievenue - Photogrammetry\n\nThe next presentation was about a technique called Orthomosaic, nowadays known as Photogrammetry. Jordan walked use through the history of this process dating back to da Vinci time. He showed how a capture of real life objects could be done using a drone and rendered in a web friendly format.\n\nHe loaded the capture of a construction site being built onto a webpage that we could interact with in 3d. As he described it, art met science.\n\n\nPercy Mamedy - Splade - The magic of Inertia.js with the simplicity of Blade\n\nPercy showcased Splade, a way to write SPAs but without really writing any JavaScript. It uses blade files and Vue renderless components to tie things together. This is targeted at backend developers who want to stay in their blade environment but still be able to add interactions to a web page, like modals, toasts, show hide panels.\n\n\nLunch\n\nWe had amazing pizzas sponsored by Acensi from L'ardoise Resto. Everyone enjoyed it, and we had a little networking session during the lunch half hour.\n\nSince Jordan was present with his drone, of course we went for drone-group-photo with the beautiful scenery.\n\n\nAbdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer - Contracting: Sharpening the edge to deliver\n\nAfter exploring new techs for a few hours, it was time to get back down to earth. Abur-Rahmaan helped everyone understand when should someone experiment with something new and when they should pick stable technologies to meet client expectations, especially for contracting or freelancing works. Replying to an audience member question, he said instead of looking at GitHub stars, GitHub forks are a better metric to know if that project can be considered for use.\n\n\nRenghen P. - Carbon Lang\n\nIn his unique ways of explaining things and his vast experience with programming languages, Renghen gave us a brief history of C and C++, before coming to Carbon Lang,  a new languages which aims to have bidirectional interoperability with C++.\n\nIt's typesafe to say he wasn't fond of the new language and advised the attendees to follow from afar.\n\n\nMichaël Jules - Astro: fast websites next-gen island architecture.\n\nMike went last this time and he show-cased QUITE THE LIST by demo'ing his newly built portfolio over at mgjules.dev\n\n * UnoCSS\n * Astro\n * VSCode DevContainer\n * Directus 9\n * Netlify Deploys\n * Swup\n * CF Edge Caching\n\nThere was a little hiccup when he tried to connect his laptop and of course, windows decided to update. But he patched through nevertheless.\n\n\nPost Meetup Chat\n\nEveryone hang out after the meetup for around half an hour, and we caught up with each other. We even had time for a small photo session. Thanks to ACENSI once again for the welcome in their beautiful office. Stay tuned for the next meetup !\n\n\nThanks to\n\n * Neil for the awesome pictures\n * Jordan for the pictures and drone photos\n * Nadeem & Reena for welcoming us\n * All speakers for taking the time to share their knowledge\n\n\nSome fun snaps",

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepramgolam/] This is the same\npresentation I gave during the Breakfast Learning Session at Ringier SA one week\nago, and I thought it just made sense to share it with the local audience. \n\nI spoke about the origins of CSS and the major evolutions that happened over the\nyears. For me, it's always !important to remember where we came from before we\nflex where we intend to float to. \n\nAfter the stroll down memory lane, I spoke about 3 upcoming features i'm excited\nabout, and I think will change radically how modern frontend development will be\ndone hence forth.

Utility Classes\n 2. Icons\n 3. Extensible via presents\n 4. Typography\n 5. and many more\n\nThere were many questions from the audience comparing it to Tailwind and other\nCSS frameworks, and it was a lot of fun. These kinds of discussions are one of\nthe reasons our meetups are so much fun. \n\nLunch\nWe took a small break for lunch and group photo as usual. Pizzas were delicious! \n\nCSS Battle\nIt was time for the CSS battle. We had 12 people who brought their own laptops\nentering the battle. The format was simple, I allocated 30 minutes total to\nsolve any 6 exercises from a predefined list. Anyone who finishes an exercise\ngets a score, and the people with the highest scores win. \n\nThe room grew quite silent 5 minutes in, and we put some metal music to\naccompany the participants. \n\nIt was a lot of fun spectating the coders at work, some were quite stressed,\nothers were chill and making jokes. It went very well.\n\nIn the end we had our 3 Winners, Ish [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishsookun/], \nNythiennzo [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nythiennzo/] and Nikhil\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-aukhaj-8662501b7/], who each won a 1 year\nlicense for any Jetbrains [https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide] \nproduct.

            "plaintext": "7 in a row ! We've hosted another meetup around frontend topics and this time we had 4 speakers, a wonderful venue at ELCA Mauritius and good pizza! There was no specific topic this time, so we just named the meetup “The October Meetup” and I suppose we had a Halloween kind of theme going on. I also organized a quiz around the web development topic and that was a lot of fun.\n\n\nIntro\n\nAs usual, I introduced our community to the new faces in the audience. I noted there were around 35 people present this time.\n\n 1. Topics for next meetup\n 2. Next meetup happening in January (hopefully)\n 3. Re-Iterate our mission statement\n 4. Announce that I will be giving professional frontend training as from next year!\n 5. CSS News\n\nSince I am not doing any presentation for this meetup, I had two quick slides for the audience showcasing Turbo Pack and Animated CSS Grid.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n 1. Kushul Soomaree - Cool CSS tricks\n 2. Renghen - Public speaking for developers\n 3. Aditya Bholah  - Data Visualization\n 4. Adarsh Hasnah - The evolution of web development\n\n\nSponsor / Host Intro\n\nI welcomed Adarsh Hasnah, Web Architect at ELCA to speak about his company and share some details with the audience.\n\nHe was very eloquent and quickly went over the different tech stack they accomodate. If you're looking for a spot in web dev, reach out to him!\n\n\nKushul Soomaree - Cool CSS tricks\n\nKushul, who is also co-organizer of Frontend Coders Meetups, was first for the presentations of the day. He shared a bunch of cool CSS one-liners with demos. A lot of useful stuff that can make our lives as a frontend developer easier.\n\nI learned about transform: scale(-1) to invert an image, CSS @supports, scroll snapping among others things. There were a few questions from the audience and the session was quite fun and defintely informative.\n\n\nRenghen - Public speaking for developers\n\nRenghen shared his knowledge about public speaking with the audience. His presentation was geared towards technical presentations given by software engineers at meetups and conferences. He shared tips about things to do, and NOT to do during presentations.\n\nA few of his recommendations as follows:\n\n * Do not show off\n * The presentation is not about the presenter\n * Prepare the topic well\n * Be eloquent\n * Have a backup strategy in case of technical issues\n\n\nLunch break ! Pizza Time\n\nAs usual, when noon approached, we took a break and had some pizza and soft drinks. We then gathered the crowd for a group photo in the office.\n\n\nAditya Bholah - Data Visualization\n\nAditya, Data Scientist at RAPP gave a presentation about the different kinds of data visualizations that exists and when to use them.\n\nI learned about a few names of charts that i've used before without knowing their names.\n\nData by itself is not very useful and Data Viz is one of the powerful tools that can be used to give meaning to data and quickly convey meaning quickly.\n\n\nAdarsh Hasnah - The evolution of web development\n\n\n\nNext up was Adarsh. He gave a very interesting presentation that goes through the history of web dev. From the old days when HTML & CSS began, through the newer eras of Component Driven frameworks such as AngularJS to the latest and greatest tech like React, Nuxt, Qwik, Astro.\n\nIt was a fun presentation with some lively questions. It was refreshing to see someone really well versed in the field of web development, how things eventually came to be. He mentioned that a lot of people nowadays can be very proficient in a particular framework, but don't actually understand the tooling behind their framework. A sentiment I fully agree with. It's both a good and a bad thing, because it allows someone to be productive fast, but also they can get stuck in loops should they meet tool-level issues.\n\n\nQuiz Time\n\nWe had another give away this month, a 1-year JetBrains license for any of their products. Instead of going for the CSS Battle, we tried another formula, a quiz hosted on Kahoot in which everyone could participate.\n\nThe logistic requirements were much less and participation much higher. Special thanks to Michael Jules for helping me prepare the questions. We were the only two people not allowed to participate, naturally.\n\nThe quiz had 26 participants and lasted around 10 minutes. We had 23 questions, multiple choice, and the participants would see the questions on the screen and be able to submit their answer using their phone.\n\nIt was honestly a lot of fun and very lively session.\n\nWe'll do this again. Congrats to Mahima for narrowly winning the first place.\n\n\nConclusion & Thanks\n\nThis was a very eventful year for the frontend coders community. We managed to organize 7 meetups in a row. I think it's safe to say we have been the most active tech community this year on the island, and we hope to continue next year! It's a lot of hard work and time invested voluntarily behind the scenes to contact the sponsors, do the event promotion to let people know it's happening and making sure everyone had a good and informative time. Big thanks to Kushul & Saamiyah for helping with organization, Mahima & Mahita who has been helping with RSVPs.\n\nAlso thanks to all our sponsors for supporting community events such as Frontend Coders Meetup and providing the venue and logistics for curious and enthusiastic people.\n\nThanks for the awesome pictures Neil, Saamiyah, Mahima, Jules and everyone else who added photos to the shared album.",

            "plaintext": "This blog post is 3 months late! Life happened.\n\nIt was a lot of preparation leading up to the Developers Conference 2022. I had 3 talks lined up for this conference:\n\n * Vite\n * Vue3 (I requested to cancel this one)\n * Organizing/hosting the Lightning Talks\n\nAlthough it's nowhere near the amount of work involved in organizing a conference, it's certainly more eventful than speaking for one session. I've always considered the lighting talks as a mini-conference/meetup of its own that happens within the actual conference. As such, I try to find interesting topics from fun speakers.\n\n\nWhat is a Lightning Talks?\n\nIf you don't already know, lightning talks are small sessions, lasting 5 to 10 minutes each, in quick succession. The first edition happened in during the 2019 Developers Conference and I received very positive feedback! There was an attempt to redo it in DevCon2020 but Covid struck!\n\nWhen the conference was finally confirmed for 2022, I contacted people who I thought would be able to deliver short and fun presentations for the audience. After a 3 day conference full of technical sessions, I like keeping this session very light, and fun. The whole point is that during these numerous sessions, you will learn at least something new, if not, you had fun watching it all happen!\n\n\nIntros\n\nI made custom intro videos for all the speakers, as a treat, and to hype them up before their sessions!\n\n\nLineUp\n\n * Ish Sookun - Why mirrors matter?\n * Girish Mahabir - Containers\n * Jestha B - Web Bundles\n * Michael Jules - Directus\n * Priyeshan Sreeneebus - How to juice up your game\n * Chittesh Sham - Sound Design\n * Sandeep Ramgolam - Codeflow Girish\n\n\nIntro\n\nI setup a small countdown so that the audience knows exactly when we would begin. It's funny that a small side project of mine made it up to that huge screen, and the confetti actually worked when the timer expires. That clock was literally made with CSS.\n\n\nIsh Sookun - Why mirrors matter?\n\nAs he is the most versatile speaker out of us all, I asked Ish to open the floor and take his time as we had 30 more minutes than planned. I wanted to avoid some kind of awkward 30 minute of downtime between the end of the lightning talks and when the organizers start the closing ceremony. We did end up finishing right on time, but I couldn't do a fun quiz session I planned for last for fear of running overtime. It all worked out in the end.\n\nHe spoke about Mirrors, and why they're important. Especially for our African region. We are far away from most EU/US datacenters, and having mirrors here really change our experience of the internet.\n\n\nGirish Mahabir- Containers\n\nGirish was up next, and he spoke about containers. He's a very enthusiastic and energetic young person in tech who has been involving himself in the community, and it was refreshing seeing him up on stage sharing his experience with containers. We joked about making him stand on an actual container for the intro video, but that ended up remaining in the realm of dreams.\n\n\nJestha B  - Web Bundles\n\nJestha who's a full-stack woman in tech and has a soft spot for Go, spoke about Web Bundles. Something relative new and unknown to most people in web development.\n\n\nMichael Jules- Directus\n\nMike, who is too humble to admit that he is a 10x engineer, spoke about Directus. It's a free and open source CMS built in Vue and has been getting better and better every month. It can be considered a low/no code tool that helps you manage the content side of your websites.\n\n\nPriyeshan Sreeneebus - How to juice up your game\n\nPriyesh took the stage and impressed everyone with his amazing 5-minutes talk about how to juice up your game. The demo was fascinating and the way it was delivered really conveyed the original idea.\n\n\nChittesh Sham - Sound Design\n\nAll the intros that I made for the speakers had original soundtracks made by Chittesh. I asked him to do the lightning talk about sound design itself, and boy did he show up to the party. He built a track live on stage and within a few minutes had everyone clapping.\n\n\nSandeep Ramgolam\n\nIt was hard to top the previous session, I ended the lightning talks with a small demo of a Cloud based IDE called Codeflow that was recently released by stack blitz. I feel like I could have done a better job on this one and probably rushed it a little. I did get feedback after the talk that people didn't know about the tool and went on to use it. That was awesome to hear.\n\n\nAll Speaker Intros",

            "plaintext": "Kushul and I had been in touch with the awesome people at Providus since the Developers conference last year, and we finally got to collaborate on a frontend coders meetup in March.\n\n\n\nAs usual I kick off the meetup by presenting the Frontend Coders community to the newcomers and givng some updates.\n\n\nSponsored Segment by Providus\n\n\nMaintainable and scalable CSS using BEM - Hoolan Naipal & Kenny Oozageer\n\nWe kicked off this session by something we all love or hate; CSS ! Hoolan and Kenny shared their experience working with BEM and compared it to using no methodologies or something like tailwindcss.\n\nIt was a really fun session as both hosts were really fun in their delivery. We had interesting question and answers during this session. I obviously sided with the tailwind camp, but it was nice seeing real world arguments for and against certain ways to build software.\n\n\nPowerful Routing & Optimizing Images with NextJS. - Sandy Ramiah\n\nSandy, first time speaker at the frontend coders meetups, spoke about Next.js and some features that make your lives easier as a developer. I haven't used Next.js myself (except to build the OG Image generator for the frontend.mu website), but a lot of the things he showed really resembled how things work in Nuxt.js, and it all just made sense.\n\nI'm kinda glad we're having more or less the same things across frameworks. It makes it easier to switch between them, and also feels reassuring that something is probably right if more than one team adopt the same way of doing it.\n\n\nWebContainers - Sandeep Ramgolam\n\nI did a live demo of Stackblitz's Web container technology, which was heavily inspired by the video of Tejas Kumar on his YouTube channel. During the session, we built our or web server, but running in a container in the web browser.\n\nIt was kinda off-putting to see this even work in the browser. At the end we had more questions than answers, however it was obvious that this technology was fascinating and got people thinking about potential use-cases.\n\n\nLunch & Photoshoot\n\nThe sponsor of the day, Providus, provided the lunch for all the attendees and then we headed out for a group photo of everyone present.\n\nWe then took some time for networking before resuming the next session\n\n\n\n\nQuiz & Giveaway\n\nWe had big prizes this week. Frontend Coders Mauritius reached out to GitNation for  a possible collaboration and they were glad to offer us tickets to their upcoming conferences VueJS London and JSNation Amsterdam! Those were up for grabs during the kahoot session. Unfortunately, it seems not many of the winners will be able to properly take advantage of this conference ticket because they need to get to Europe and the flight prices are really, really expensive.\n\nThere was also a jetbrains license to win and some tshirts and a soccer ball from Providus.\n\nThis was the most prizes we gave away during one event, and it was a really fun quiz session as well.

It was fascinating to see the services they offer, in addition to co-working spaces or office spaces, things like virtual address etc.. were mentioned.\n\n\nFrontend News\n\nBefore jumping to the first segment, I did a small recap of the news in frontend and open source world as so many things happened recently. Those included:\n\n * GNOME 45- Chrome 117 Shipped\n * Bun 1.0 is released\n * Astro 3.0 is released\n * v0.dev\n * Typescript Drama TURBO\n * Unity License Drama\n * Kamal by 37Signals Released\n * Svelte Runes\n * Lodash Issue Bankrupcy\n * Next Conf\n * Vite Conf\n * Vue Certification is live\n * nuejs\n * node 16 EOL\n * node 20 LTS\n\n\nNicolas Mannoo - Intro to Supabase\n\n\n\nNicolas is the dev who helped us build our authentication system for frontend.mu to allow people to RSVP for meetups directly on the website. That system was built using Supabase, and in his first talk ever at the frontend.mu meetup he gave an overview of what supabase is and why it's a great tool.\n\nThe Q & A session was really fun. There were questions about RLS, self-hosting and would a DB Admin ever pick supabase instead of something like postgres.\n\n\nJain Ramchurn - Containerizing a NodeJS application\n\nJain is a very talentend platform engineer who's also the admin of the Local Linux Mirrors in Mauritius. In his presentation today he showed ways to improve a docker file to take advantages of various features of how containerization works in order to have a more efficient docker configuration. I was really impressed and learned a lot during this talk.\n\nI learned about Layers and entrypoints, PID 1 among other things. There was a lot of interesting questions during this presentation as well, and it was apparent that most people learned new things. Ish gracefully expanded on a few points to elaborate on some answers.\n\n\nSandeep Ramgolam - Ways to increase developer happiness.\n\nI prepared a presentation to share my experience about how a developer can increase their own happiness. This presentation was intentionally built to be lighthearted so that the advice dropped along the way could feel relatable.

            "html": "<p>We are on a tropical island, and it should be doable to have a fun event among geeks, outdoors, near white sand! The idea had been thrown around a few times, but we never tried to make it happen seriously …until now. A tech meetup at the seaside actually happened, and we all had a great time !  </p><h2 id=\"planning\">Planning</h2><p>Like all previous meetups we invest a lot of time into planning the next one and the beach meetup presented new challenges, location, accessibility, carpooling, finding sponsors, communicating with all RSVP's. </p><h3 id=\"location\">Location</h3><p>We debated a few location ideas, and it was <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kushul-soomaree-515502147/\">Kushul's</a> idea to do it at La Cambuse Public beach. Around a month ago we visited Bois des Amourettes Government school where we participated in an <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7120794588373475329\">early Christmas gathering</a> on behalf of <a href=\"https://upcode.mu/\">Upcode.mu</a> with the kids. On the same day, we headed towards the beach to scout for a spot that would be suitable for the meetup. We picked a place that would be mostly covered by the trees for maximum shade, close to the water, and far from the public, to avoid potential partying noises. </p><h3 id=\"not-finding-sponsors\">(not) Finding sponsors</h3><p>It was surprisingly hard to convince the local companies to sponsor the meetup. I thought they would jump on the opportunity to promote the local scenery, especially those hiring devs from other countries to come work here. We had a few discussions and exchange emails with some companies, sadly none of them committed to sponsoring us. </p><p>A couple of days before the meetup, my good friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fluxy/\">Yusuf AbdoolSatar</a> extended his help to sponsor the lunch of this meetup, for which we are extremely grateful! 🎉</p><h3 id=\"weather\">Weather</h3><p>The week leading up to the 18th Nov was rainy with storms around the island, which means we had no other choice other than <em>hoping</em> the rain will not spoil our plans. We thank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdogawaZain\">Zain</a> for his fervent prayers, which wrought the favor of the celestial beings, steering the wrath of the rain gods away.</p><h3 id=\"the-artwork\">THE Artwork</h3><p>Kushul asked me for an artwork with a beach background to promote the event. In retrospect, I should have spent more than 5 minutes on photopea to make it a little less violent on the viewers' eyes. I apologize for that abomination. 😂</p><h3 id=\"carpooling\">Carpooling</h3><p>After obtaining everyone's contact detail via the RSVP form, we shortlisted the people who needed a lift. Kushul liaised with each of them individually to make sure someone else coming to the meetup could give them a lift. I picked up Ravi, Cedric and Aina from Vacoas at around 8.45am and proceeded to the location.</p><h2 id=\"arriving-at-la-cambuse\">Arriving at La Cambuse<br></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1296\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/image.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/image.png 2400w\"></figure><p>When we reached the beach, Alex and Mrs Delphine and Ankshita were already there. Shortly after, Dereck and Noorani joined us, and we started setting up. We had to carry the chairs, tent, and table on our back and everyone helped. 🙏</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1444\" height=\"1572\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image-1.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png 1444w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>It took some time to set up the tent, plastic carpet, test the internet connection and meanwhile the crowd grew. Everyone who joined was wearing a big smile and the mood was very vibrant and positive !</p><h2 id=\"presentation-without-a-tv-or-projector-how\">Presentation without a TV or Projector? How?</h2><p>We had a plan, and it worked ! The idea was to share the presenter's screen over a jitsi video call where everyone could join and see the presenter's screen clearly. I contacted Zain, Alex and Ish to find a solution about how we could run Jitsi on a LAN. So that we don't have to rely on an internet connection, but that was turning out to be more complicated than it needed to be. </p><p>In the end <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishsookun/\">Ish</a> hosted a jitsi server for us on a local server in ebene, and we were able to enjoy local connection speed without any other setup. It worked perfectly!</p><h2 id=\"the-meetup\">The Meetup</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1432\" height=\"1668\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image-2.png 1432w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>At around 10:40am I started the meetup by greeting everyone and welcoming the new faces.

            "plaintext": "We are on a tropical island, and it should be doable to have a fun event among geeks, outdoors, near white sand! The idea had been thrown around a few times, but we never tried to make it happen seriously …until now. A tech meetup at the seaside actually happened, and we all had a great time !\n\n\nPlanning\n\nLike all previous meetups we invest a lot of time into planning the next one and the beach meetup presented new challenges, location, accessibility, carpooling, finding sponsors, communicating with all RSVP's.\n\n\nLocation\n\nWe debated a few location ideas, and it was Kushul's idea to do it at La Cambuse Public beach. Around a month ago we visited Bois des Amourettes Government school where we participated in an early Christmas gathering on behalf of Upcode.mu with the kids. On the same day, we headed towards the beach to scout for a spot that would be suitable for the meetup. We picked a place that would be mostly covered by the trees for maximum shade, close to the water, and far from the public, to avoid potential partying noises.\n\n\n(not) Finding sponsors\n\nIt was surprisingly hard to convince the local companies to sponsor the meetup. I thought they would jump on the opportunity to promote the local scenery, especially those hiring devs from other countries to come work here. We had a few discussions and exchange emails with some companies, sadly none of them committed to sponsoring us.\n\nA couple of days before the meetup, my good friend Yusuf AbdoolSatar extended his help to sponsor the lunch of this meetup, for which we are extremely grateful! 🎉\n\n\nWeather\n\nThe week leading up to the 18th Nov was rainy with storms around the island, which means we had no other choice other than hoping the rain will not spoil our plans. We thank Zain for his fervent prayers, which wrought the favor of the celestial beings, steering the wrath of the rain gods away.\n\n\nTHE Artwork\n\nKushul asked me for an artwork with a beach background to promote the event. In retrospect, I should have spent more than 5 minutes on photopea to make it a little less violent on the viewers' eyes. I apologize for that abomination. 😂\n\n\nCarpooling\n\nAfter obtaining everyone's contact detail via the RSVP form, we shortlisted the people who needed a lift. Kushul liaised with each of them individually to make sure someone else coming to the meetup could give them a lift. I picked up Ravi, Cedric and Aina from Vacoas at around 8.45am and proceeded to the location.\n\n\nArriving at La Cambuse\n\n\nWhen we reached the beach, Alex and Mrs Delphine and Ankshita were already there. Shortly after, Dereck and Noorani joined us, and we started setting up. We had to carry the chairs, tent, and table on our back and everyone helped. 🙏\n\nIt took some time to set up the tent, plastic carpet, test the internet connection and meanwhile the crowd grew. Everyone who joined was wearing a big smile and the mood was very vibrant and positive !\n\n\nPresentation without a TV or Projector? How?\n\nWe had a plan, and it worked ! The idea was to share the presenter's screen over a jitsi video call where everyone could join and see the presenter's screen clearly. I contacted Zain, Alex and Ish to find a solution about how we could run Jitsi on a LAN. So that we don't have to rely on an internet connection, but that was turning out to be more complicated than it needed to be.\n\nIn the end Ish hosted a jitsi server for us on a local server in ebene, and we were able to enjoy local connection speed without any other setup. It worked perfectly!\n\n\nThe Meetup\n\nAt around 10:40am I started the meetup by greeting everyone and welcoming the new faces. I asked Yusuf to say a few words as our sponsor, and he mentioned the revival of the GophersMU user group and invited anyone interested in the language to join their activities. Shortly after, Cherwine, Mervyn, Mike, Dan etc joined us.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n * Abdallah Yashir RamsingNavigating Monorepos: Your Gentle Introduction to Efficient Web Development\n * Alexandre BissessurUnderstanding the basics of Kubernetes\n * Cedric PoillyTrivia is more fun with a touch of AI\n * Ankshita MaunthrooaGolang for beginners\n\n\nNavigating Monorepos by Abdallah\n\nAbdallah opened the meetup by speaking about his experience on Monorepos and the world of tools that exist to manage monorepos.\n\nThere were quite a few questions and answers around the topic, with people sharing their experience on the topic.\n\n\nGolang for Beginners by Ankshita\n\nAnkshita shared an introduction to the language to ease people into understanding its main strengths and who could benefit from it.\n\nYusuf elaborated on a few questions from the audience, and it appears Cedric, might take the dive into go very soon for his personal projects.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Kubernetes by Alex\n\nAlex took the \"stage\" next and gave us a very well crafted presentation and live demo of k8s. He actually ran the frontend.mu website, on a cluster of raspberry pies at his house, by SSH'ing into it from the beach.\n\nThat was really cool for those who understand the different layers of awesomeness involved here. And yes, it worked.\n\nI appreciate how well he was able to convey what he knows but also when he couldn't answer something, he didn't beat around the bush and acknowledged it immediately. It shows trustworthiness and reliability.\n\n\nLunch break & group photo\n\nPizza was here, after Kushul managed to convince them to deliver it at the beach, and it was still hot! We took a break, had food while everyone networked.\n\nAfter a while, I asked everyone to gather in front of the beach, where we took a group photo.\n\nI couldn't take one with my drone because the area is a restricted zone.\n\n\nBuilding trivia games with AI by Cedric.\n\nCedric prepared a presentation and demo of his game and how he incorporated AI into his coding process. If you don't know Cedric, streams on twitch regularly where he builds his projects live on stream ! After his presentation, we actually played the game once as a test and then held another round where 3 JetBrains licenses were up for raffles.\n\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThe meetup went much better than we could have expected. The vibe be really positive and it was worthy of being our last meetup for the year.\n\n\nImprovements\n\n * Audio - Most speakers had to raise their voices so that they were audible to the audience. A device to amplify the sound would have greatly improved the experience. This is something we want to improve in general. Audio engineers in the crowd? Please get in touch!\n * The location was great, but quite remote. Perhaps next time we could find a place that is more accessible.\n\n\nPost Meetup\n\nA few of us stayed back to enjoy the cool breeze and great view after the meetup. The nerdy discussions continued, of course. And we had a really great time together ! We packed up around 4.30PM and carried all our stuff and empty pizza boxes to the garbage bins.\n\n\nInterested to host a meetup next year?\n\nIf you want to host a frontend.mu meetup next year, get in touch with me or Kushul. Until then, see you !",
