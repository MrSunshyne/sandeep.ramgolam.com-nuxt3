# Introducing BaselineBanner - Check CSS feature compatibility for developers and authors

BaselineBanner is a simple way to check if a CSS feature is supported in the browser. You can already do that by going to webstatus.dev/baseline. But if you're writing a blog post or a documentation, you can use BaselineBanner to display the compatibility information directly in your content.

Here are some examples of how you can use BaselineBanner:

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="container-queries"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="popover"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="grid"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="flexbox"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="custom-properties"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>

<BaselineCheckerWrapper feature-name="if"></BaselineCheckerWrapper>


## Why

As i was writing a blog post about [CSS if() function](/blog/71-css-if-function-guide) and [CSS random() function](/blog/70-css-random-function-guide), I wish i could display the compatibility information directly in my content. I remember there was an api available to get the compatibility information, so i decided to create a simple vue component to display the compatibility information within my blog. Then I thought perhaps it could be useful for others too, so i decided to publish it as a npm package. [https://www.npmjs.com/org/baseline-banner](https://www.npmjs.com/org/baseline-banner).

I also saw this video on ChromeDevs channel [about Baseline Tooling Hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayVPB3O-Lcw) 2 days ago, so things were lining up pretty well to go ahead and make this a real project. Maybe I can submit this for the hackathon too :D

## Enter BaselineBanner

BaselineBanner provides ready-to-use components that display real-time compatibility information using MDN's [web-features data](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features). It shows you the baseline status for any CSS feature:

- **‚úÖ Widely Available** - Safe to use in production
- **üü° Newly Available** - Recently became baseline
- **üî¥ Limited Availability** - Use with caution
- **‚ùì Unknown** - Data not available

## Framework Support

I use vue and nuxt mostly but since I wanted this to be available to other people, it makes sense to extract the core logic and styles into a separate package and then create wrappers for other frameworks.

| Framework | Package | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Vue 3 | `@baseline-banner/vue` | ‚úÖ Available |
| React | `@baseline-banner/react` | ‚úÖ Available |
| Svelte | `@baseline-banner/svelte` | üîÑ Maybe? |
| Solid | `@baseline-banner/solid` | üîÑ Maybe? |

## Nuxt Support via ClientOnly 

Nuxt has a special component called `ClientOnly` that allows you to only render the component on the client side. This is useful because we want to avoid rendering the component on the server side as it can cause problems with hydration. This is what i'm using in the current blog you're reading.

## But doesn't [BaselineStatus](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-status) already exist? 

Yes it does, and I had no idea I was midway through building the project. I kept going anyway because BaselineStatus serves a Web Component and my goal was to provide simple components for other frameworks. This is going to be a great source of inspiration ! 

## Getting Started

### Vue 3 Setup

```bash
pnpm add @baseline-banner/vue @baseline-banner/styles
```

```vue
<script setup>
import { BaselineChecker } from '@baseline-banner/vue'
import '@baseline-banner/styles'
</script>

<template>
  <BaselineChecker feature-name="container-queries" />
</template>
```

### React Setup

```bash
pnpm add @baseline-banner/react @baseline-banner/styles
```

```jsx
import { BaselineChecker } from '@baseline-banner/react'
import '@baseline-banner/styles'

function App() {
  return <BaselineChecker featureName="container-queries" />
}
```
## Intellisense through TypeScript

There's a types file derived from the [web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features) data, so you'll get intellisense when you're using it.

## What I couldn't do

I tried checking if the newly announced css "random()" function was there to be checked, but turns out it's not even listed on baseline yet. Maybe it's too early? I guess we'll find out soon !

## What's next

- Add support for more frameworks
- Improve the look and feel of the banner

## Contributing & Roadmap


The project is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/MrSunshyne/baseline-banner) and contributions are welcome!
